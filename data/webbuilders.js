      "Cookie-cutter websites lack uniqueness, personalization, and differentiation, which can negatively impact your brand's credibility and online presence. Because you probably searched for a template related to your industry, chances are that others have as well. Those clients visiting your site will find similarities between your website and your competitors'.",
